# CS 100 Assignment 2 -- Variables

Complete all 6 problems below.  Examples are provided as guides of what a working solution might look like when it's run.  Your program does not need to match the text or style exactly like the example in order to pass the tests.  

### Problem 1 -- Average.py
Use the  Average.py file to write a step-by-step algorithm that calculates the average of 3 floating point numbers (numbers with a fractional part). Ask the user for the numbers one by one. The print the average with some nice formating text. 

Example:

### Problem 2 -- Distance.py
Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:

Distance = Speed Ã— Time

A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. In the Distance.py file write a program that displays the following:
* The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
* The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
* The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

Label your output using a descriptive text explaining the program results to the user.

Example:

### Problem 3 -- CelsiusToFahrenheit.py
In the CelsiusToFahrenheit file write a program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The formula is as follows:

F = 9/5 C + 32

Ask the user to enter degrees Celsius, then display the temperature converted to  Fahrenheit. Make sure to label your output with descriptive text.

### Problem 5 -- Acres.py
One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. In the Acres.py file write a program that asks the user to enter the total square feet in a tract of land and calculates the number of acres in the tract. Hint: Divide the amount entered by 43,560 to get the number of acres.

Example:

###Problem 6  -- Drawing.py
Use the turtle graphics to draw:
1) A Five Pointed Star
2) The Olympic Rings
3) A 3D Cube

There is no auto grading for this problem so please take a screenshot of you Turtle graphics window and submit it along with the assignment on Blackboard.

**Style Matters**: Comment your code, use good variable descriptive variable names.  Pay attention to spacing and formatting.  Your code should tell the story of what it does. 

**Commit As You Go**: Commit and push your code to Github as you finish each section or even more often.  This will act as a back up and history of your changes.  Only the last commit before the deadline will be graded.  

**Turn It In**: Once you're done make sure your code is committed to Github.  Then copy the repository URL and pasting it into your submission on Blackboard. Don't forget to upload a screen shot of the output from #6.
